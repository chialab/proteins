# EventManager

Event-driven application are all around the web. Every (good) JS library or framework provides its method to listen and trigger custom events in order to keep in connection all the modules which it aims to handle.

In Proteins, this features is provided by 3 friendly methods that work with **any** object source:

-   `on`: sets up a listener on an object
-   `trigger`: dispatches a custom event
-   `off`: destroys a listener

## Import the methods

```js
// from the Proteins module
import { on, trigger } from '@chialab/proteins';
```

### Listen and trigger events

```js
on(window, 'change', (timestamp) => {
    console.log(timestamp);
});

trigger(window, 'change', Date.now());
```

### Remove a specific listener

The simplest way to remove a listener from an object is to use the `off` method:

```js
const callback = (timestamp) => {
    console.log(timestamp);
};

// set up the listener
on(window, 'change', callback);
// dispatch the event
trigger(window, 'change', Date.now());
// remove the listener
off(window, 'change', callback);
// dispatch the event again, but callback is not fired
trigger(window, 'change', Date.now());
```

Another way is to use the return value of the `on` method:

```js
// set up the listener
let listenerDestroyer = on(window, 'change', (timestamp) => {
    console.log(timestamp);
});
// dispatch the event
trigger(window, 'change', Date.now());
// remove the listener
listenerDestroyer();
// dispatch the event again, but callback is not fired
trigger(window, 'change', Date.now());
```

### Remove multiple (or all) listeners

You can quickly remove bunch of events too, using less parameters for the `off` function:

```js
// remove a single callback
off(window, 'change', callback);
// remove all listeners for the 'change' event
off(window, 'change');
// remove all listeners from window
off(window);
```

## The `EmitterMixin` and the `Emitter` class

Proteins does not only provide the event feature, but extends it to classes, in order to add listeners directly to object instances. The built-in `Factory.Emitter` class provides `on`, `off` and `trigger` methods bound with its prototype:

```js
import { Factory } from '@chialab/proteins';

class Shelf extends Emitter {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.books = [];
    }
    addBook(book) {
        this.books.push(book);
        this.trigger('added');
    }
}

let shelf = new Shelf();

shelf.on('added', () => {
    // render shelf
});
```

### Listen to other objects

Proteins' `Emitter` prototype has two special methods for listening to other `Emitter` objects: `listen` and `unlisten`.

```js
const library = new Emitter();

shelf.listen(library, 'bought', (book) => {
    shelf.addBook(book);
});

library.trigger('bought', { title: 'The Chronicles of Narnia' });

// remove the listener
shelf.unlisten(library, 'bought');
```

As of the `off` method, calling `unlisten` without parameters destroys all listener generated by the scope.

### Listen the invisible

If you already have a class (maybe from another library), but you want to add Proteins' events feature, you can use the mixin:

```js
import { Factory, mix } from '@chialab/proteins';

const Chart = mix(MyChartClass).with(Factory.EmitterMixin);

let chart = new Chart();

chart.on('data', () => {
    // render chart
});
```
