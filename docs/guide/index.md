# Getting started

## Overview

**Proteins is something little to produce big results.**

It is a set of tools for libraries and frameworks developers, a _primer_ for just starting to code some beauty without to waste time in "rewrite" the wheel.

It also cares about your (and your users') bandwidth: no dependencies and less than 5kb bundled and gzipped.

Proteins is written using pure ES6 JavaScript, without DOM assumptions, so it works (ðŸ¤ž) everywhere: Node environments, evergreen browsers, NativeScript, Electron.
